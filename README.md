# Portfolio-Performance-Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a simulated investment portfolio managed over a 13-week period, from September to December 2024, as part of a Business Economics 365 final project. The portfolio aimed to balance stability, growth potential, and diversification across industries and market capitalizations. Decisions were guided by the need to adapt to changing market conditions while maintaining a focus on both short-term (about a week) and long-term (12 to 13 weeks) opportunities.

## Portfolio Composition and Strategy

The portfolio featured a broad range of industries and market capitalizations. Initial stock purchases included companies like AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), Adobe Inc. (ADBE), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB), Duolingo, Inc. (DUOL), and others, spanning Pharmaceuticals, Software, Banking, E-commerce, Aerospace, Educational Technology, and more.

The initial market capitalization breakdown of all purchased stocks was 38.4% Large Cap, 34.6% Mid Cap, and 26.9% Small Cap. However, the portfolio composition evolved over time, with Large Cap stocks making up an average of 56.63% of holdings week to week, compared to 18.77% for Mid Cap and 9.68% for Small Cap. This shift occurred as Large Cap stocks provided more consistent and stable returns.

The current portfolio composition at Week 13 included CAVA Group, Inc. (CAVA), Duolingo, Inc. (DUOL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Harmony Biosciences Holdings, Inc. (HRMY), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (AMG), Light & Wonder, Inc. (LNW), Joby Aviation, Inc. (JOBY), Krispy Kreme, Inc. (DNUT), SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN), and Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NOVA).

## Trading Activity

Trading activity was an "ever changing approach" shaped by performance outcomes and evolving risk tolerance. A total of 68 trades were executed over the 13-week period. Decisions to buy or sell were influenced by stock performance, with a tendency to favor safer options when facing losses and take more risks when the portfolio value increased.

Core holdings like CAVA, DUOL, and AMZN provided consistent performance. For example, CAVA delivered strong weighted returns, including +10.11% in Week 4 and +15.44% in Week 9. DUOL was a standout performer, achieving an extraordinary +699.32% return in Week 9, a direct outcome of a significant re-balancing decision between Week 8 and Week 9. AMZN provided stability with highlights like +54.90% in Week 4. Stocks like AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) and Adobe Inc. (ADBE) were sold early due to underperformance.
