# Portfolio-Performance-Analysis

## Project Overview

[cite_start]This repository showcases a simulated investment portfolio managed over a 13-week period, from September to December 2024, as part of a Business Economics 365 final project. [cite_start]The portfolio aimed to balance stability, growth potential, and diversification across industries and market capitalizations. [cite_start]Decisions were guided by the need to adapt to changing market conditions while maintaining a focus on both short-term (about a week) and long-term (12 to 13 weeks) opportunities.

* `Portfolio_Model.xlsx`: The Excel financial model used for tracking portfolio performance. (Note: This file needs to be uploaded to your repository.)

## Portfolio Composition and Strategy

[cite_start]The portfolio featured a broad range of industries and market capitalizations. [cite_start]Initial stock purchases included companies like AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), Adobe Inc. (ADBE), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB), Duolingo, Inc. (DUOL), and others, spanning Pharmaceuticals, Software, Banking, E-commerce, Aerospace, Educational Technology, and more.

[cite_start]The initial market capitalization breakdown of all purchased stocks was 38.4% Large Cap, 34.6% Mid Cap, and 26.9% Small Cap. [cite_start]However, the portfolio composition evolved over time, with Large Cap stocks making up an average of 56.63% of holdings week to week, compared to 18.77% for Mid Cap and 9.68% for Small Cap. [cite_start]This shift occurred as Large Cap stocks provided more consistent and stable returns.

[cite_start]The current portfolio composition at Week 13 included CAVA Group, Inc. (CAVA), Duolingo, Inc. (DUOL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Harmony Biosciences Holdings, Inc. (HRMY), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (AMG), Light & Wonder, Inc. (LNW), Joby Aviation, Inc. (JOBY), Krispy Kreme, Inc. (DNUT), SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN), and Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NOVA).

## Trading Activity

[cite_start]Trading activity showed an "ever changing approach" shaped by performance outcomes and evolving risk tolerance. [cite_start]A total of 68 trades were executed over the 13-week period. [cite_start]Decisions to buy or sell were influenced by stock performance, with a tendency to favor safer options when facing losses and take more risks when the portfolio value increased.

[cite_start]Core holdings like CAVA, DUOL, and AMZN provided consistent performance. [cite_start]For example, CAVA delivered strong weighted returns, including +10.11% in Week 4 and +15.44% in Week 9. [cite_start]DUOL was a standout performer, achieving an extraordinary +699.32% return in Week 9, a direct outcome of a significant re-balancing decision between Week 8 and Week 9. [cite_start]AMZN provided stability with highlights like +54.90% in Week 4. [cite_start]Stocks like AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) and Adobe Inc. (ADBE) were sold early due to underperformance.

## Performance Analysis

[cite_start]The portfolio's average weekly return was -1.72%, while the market index averaged 1.42%. [cite_start]However, the portfolio significantly outpaced the market in Weeks 10 through 13.

## Asset Class Performance

* [cite_start]**Large Cap Stocks**: Delivered a mean return of 10.63% within the portfolio. [cite_start]Contributions were evident in Week 4 (44.67%) and Week 7 (49.98%), with stocks like DUOL and CAVA excelling. [cite_start]The Large Cap ETF (VV) averaged 0.51%.
* [cite_start]**Mid Cap Stocks**: Displayed erratic behavior with a mean return of 0.35%. [cite_start]Week 2 saw a surge of 52.38%, but subsequent weeks struggled. [cite_start]The Mid Cap ETF (VO) averaged 0.76%.
* [cite_start]**Small Cap Stocks**: Presented the greatest challenge, with a mean return of -18.15%. [cite_start]Their performance was highly volatile, including a -96.61% decline in Week 9. [cite_start]The Small Cap ETF (VB) had a mean return of 0.87%.

## Inter-Stock Correlation

[cite_start]A correlation matrix of portfolio stocks highlighted relationships:
* [cite_start]High positive correlations: CAVA and DUOL (93.51%), AMZN and DUOL (88.26%) amplified the impact of shared market trends.
* [cite_start]Negative correlations: CAVA and NOVA (-88.83%), AMG and NOVA (-78.97%) indicated diversification opportunities that helped buffer the portfolio.
* [cite_start]Weaker correlations, like LNW and SOUN (-15.67%), contributed to reducing portfolio volatility by behaving more independently.

## Lessons Learned

[cite_start]Key lessons from this 13-week journey include:
* [cite_start]The importance of thorough research before stock selection.
* [cite_start]Understanding the different risk/reward profiles of large, mid, and small-cap stocks.
* [cite_start]The challenge of achieving effective diversification beyond personal preferences.
* [cite_start]The importance of understanding broader market trends and seasonal fluctuations.
